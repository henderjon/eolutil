# eolutil

I didn't want to fart around trying to get dos2unix to compile on macOS so I wrote a *very* simple EOL utility.

```
Usage of ./eolutil:
  -debug
    	once more, with feeling
  -f string
    	the file on which to act
  -help
    	show this message
  -i	modify the file in place instead of echoing to STDOUT
  -rn
    	use \r\n instead of \n
```
